# Contributors

Chat On Steroids is maintained by [@totec448-spec](https://github.com/totec448-spec) and built with contributions from the community.

Some contributions were adapted into maintainer snapshot commits and their original PRs were closed without preserving GitHub commit attribution. That was our mistake. Reworking a patch does not erase its author's contribution. The record below restores explicit credit and links to the original work.

## Incorporated code and designs

Listed alphabetically by GitHub handle. "Adapted" means the implementation changed during integration; it does not mean the entire original branch was merged.

Adapted to the current dirty tree with bounded diagnostic reads, atomic file replacement, current composer ownership and retained editor drafts. |
| [@ehkogh](https://github.com/ehkogh) | Literal-paste compatibility for successive sends through ChatGPT's Markdown composer, adapted from [#321](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/321) with a focused regression for the current composer. |
| [@hhh2210](https://github.com/hhh2210) | Native macOS Desktop backend and platform validation: merged [#28](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/28). Desktop reply provenance, activity details, editable folder access and the bounded bridge RFC: merged [#74](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/74), [#75](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/75), [#77](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/77), [#43](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/43). Companion mismatch guidance: [#101](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/101), adapted into [#91](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/91). |
| [@holzhaker1](https://github.com/holzhaker1) | Model-discovery tab/document custody across MV3 restarts, passive first-window discovery and optional Harpoon-channel diagnostics from [#251](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/251). The log filter was narrowed to exact channel evidence. |
| [@igorbelchior86](https://github.com/igorbelchior86) | Restoring native macOS fullscreen through the existing window option: [#245](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/245). Codex Skills discovery, packages, metadata, searchable library and selection-chip design from [#260](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/260), adapted to the current approved roots, managed-file checks, authored drafts and prompt budgeting. |
| [@Inmerson](https://github.com/Inmerson) | Fresh worker placement through the Prime's extension context, background tabs and a single fallback owner: [#72](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/72), adapted for batch-safe placement. Independent screenshot coordinate assertions: [#201](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/201). Preserving existing Goal/Loop recovery through provider access limits: [#227](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/227), adapted to retain the original recovery deadline across repeated notices. |
| [@JeshuaCastro](https://github.com/JeshuaCastro) | Per-worker model and reasoning selection design: [#68](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/68). The incorporated design was completed by the schema correction in [#87](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/87) through [#91](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/91). |
| [@jose350](https://github.com/jose350) | Spanish interface and locale-selection support from [#240](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/240). The integrated catalog was extended for current 2.1.13 labels and the Files/diagnostics additions. |
| [@K4viar](https://github.com/K4viar) | Keeping the recorder's Compact & Resume admission wait within the existing claim window: adapted from [#224](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/224), with independent delayed-commit, cancellation and expiry regressions. The Project-click retries were not incorporated. |
| [@lookvincent](https://github.com/lookvincent) | Native ChatGPT artifact downloads and custom OpenAI-compatible Goal/Loop providers: [#94](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/94) and [#95](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/95), adapted into [#91](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/91). |
| [@Masikomoore](https://github.com/Masikomoore) / mixiZhu | Keeping npm plugin installation inside its assigned generation when an ancestor is an npm project: merged [#268](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/268), submitted by @Masikomoore with the original patch authored as mixiZhu. |
| [@Maximapple](https://github.com/Maximapple) | Merged fixes for public-history scope, Project routes, swapped mouse buttons, tunnel readiness, access limits, RTL text, Linux packaging, complete session enumeration and continuation relays: [#37](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/37), [#38](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/38), [#79](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/79), [#110](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/110), [#116](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/116), [#117](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/117), [#131](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/131), [#139](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/139), [#141](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/141). Adapted work on handoff lifetime, macOS sealing, Project successors, worker schemas, custom instructions and caller-evidence waits: [#39](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/39), [#80](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/80), [#86](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/86), [#87](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/88), [#115](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/115). |
| [@nofihq](https://github.com/nofihq) | Waiting for late exact `session_finish` identity while sharing one bounded deadline with the finish hold: adapted from [#220](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/220). Other response-branch and inbox changes were not incorporated. |
| [@PatrickSys](https://github.com/PatrickSys) | Windows installer sandbox folder permissions: [#62](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/62), incorporated into the 2.0.6 snapshot and retained in [#91](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/91). |
| [@pop15106](https://github.com/pop15106) | Correcting the unconditional Codex-quota claim in the README and hero: [#192](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/192), adapted with current official usage documentation. |
| [@TaeyanG4](https://github.com/TaeyanG4) | Handling plugin schemas when a Refresh control is unavailable: [#92](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/92), adapted into [#91](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/91). |
| [@ventianima-lab](https://github.com/ventianima-lab) | Preserving the exact message, conversation and page-epoch identity accepted by a desktop-send ACK when later canonical text differs, so the same send retains its turn-start boundary: adapted from the [code and regression tests in #185](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/185#issuecomment-5647883368). This narrow repair does not reconstruct earlier missing history or resolve every symptom in the issue. |
| [@yahiaal](https://github.com/yahiaal) | Publishing larger Plugins catalogs within the existing schema byte budget: [#216](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/216), adapted to include the optional local code-mode tool in refresh observation and legacy enrollment. |

The September 12 repair snapshot also adapts [@Maximapple](https://github.com/Maximapple)'s
destination loading guard ([#164](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/164)),
expired automatic resume claim release ([#165](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/165)),
nested user-message text fix ([#179](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/179)) and
disabled-permission guidance from [#146](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/146).
The claim release was strengthened with durable command/document ownership; this does not
incorporate the rest of the native Desktop proposal.

The September 17 integration also adapts [@Maximapple](https://github.com/Maximapple)'s
failed-turn compaction ([#275](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/275)),
missing-recorder repair ([#276](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/276)),
locale-aware usage assertions ([#277](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/277))
and handoff tab protection ([#278](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/278)).
The resume-timeout reproduction from [#274](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/274)
is retained with an exclusive-send regression: an unnamed resume keeps its dispatch custody
instead of reporting success or automatically resending after a transport banner. The original
banner-driven resend and process-local retry counter were not incorporated.

The September 18 dirty-tree review incorporates and adapts [@Maximapple](https://github.com/Maximapple)'s
page-model health reporting ([#284](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/284)),
draft-preserving recovery ([#286](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/286)),
Windows accessibility test allowance ([#288](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/288)),
bounded recovery-refusal logging ([#289](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/289)),
Markdown-escaped continuation readback ([#291](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/291))
and the unread-output receipt regression ([#292](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/292)).
The receipt test observes completed publication before the next invocation instead of repeatedly
trying commands. Draft protection uses the existing document/claim checks, including compaction.
The marker readers accept punctuation escapes while retaining literal brief text and rejecting
escapes before letters or digits. Recovery handout/result logging from
[#280](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/pull/280) is incorporated; its additional
blind-reload detector and request-based attempt counter are not. This is an adapted source
integration, not a claim that those seven PR branches were merged unchanged.

## Reports, review and proposed work

[@raxy24](https://github.com/raxy24)'s report in
[#262](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/262) led to the independently
implemented fix for stale assignment metadata when reusing a sleeping worker.

[@Bemirror99](https://github.com/Bemirror99)'s model-picker focus diagnostics in
[#256](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/256) led to an independently
implemented bounded picker-close check before helper/composer preparation continues.

[@ferrarinobrakes](https://github.com/ferrarinobrakes) reported the replacement-session collision
in [#218](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/218), which led to the delayed
resume-commit regression and recorder admission fix.

[@ventianima-lab](https://github.com/ventianima-lab)'s reproductions also led to the focused
resume-selection ([#155](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/155)) and Windows
plugin-path ([#178](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/178)) repairs.

The receipt-promotion and adopted-answer ownership fixes adapt
[@ventianima-lab](https://github.com/ventianima-lab)'s minimal reproductions and proposed repairs
in [#185](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/185#issuecomment-5650663451)
and its [remounted-answer follow-up](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/185#issuecomment-5651819276).
[@rcnir](https://github.com/rcnir) reported the unknown-model recovery gap in
[#172](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/172), and
[@Gauthammaster2012Code](https://github.com/Gauthammaster2012Code) reported the plan-collapse
affordance issue in [#191](https://github.com/totec448-spec/chat-on-steroids/issues/191).

## Preserving credit

Keep original authorship when merging a contribution. When adapting or consolidating contributed work, name the original author and PR, and preserve appropriate `Co-authored-by` trailers using the contributor's public GitHub noreply identity. Reports and review deserve explicit acknowledgment without inventing code authorship. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#credit-and-attribution).

The September 2026 attribution correction adds a new public record and retroactive co-author credit for incorporated work. It does not rewrite released commits or imply that contributors authored the correction's prose. GitHub's automatic contributor displays are separate from this maintained record.
