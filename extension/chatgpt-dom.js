/**
 * Everything that knows what ChatGPT's page looks like.
 *
 * This is the only file that will break when ChatGPT changes, which is why it is the
 * only file allowed to contain a selector. Every function returns a safe empty value
 * instead of throwing, so a redesign degrades the companion to "records nothing new"
 * rather than breaking the page the user is working in.
 *
 * Anchors used, in order of how directly the live page exposes them:
 *   · turn/message data-* attributes when present (data-turn-id, data-message-id,
 *     data-message-author-role, data-interrupted, data-testid)
 *   · `.markdown` for assistant prose when the current renderer supplies no assistant
 *     data-message-id; progress markdown under data-interrupted is excluded
 *   · the id #prompt-textarea on the composer, and the send/stop/dictation buttons beside
 *     it, which is where our own composer control is anchored
 *   · one structural tool-message class substring, plus a display-contents row shape that
 *     is confirmed structurally (short header line, no prose) before it is believed
 *
 * None of these are a public ChatGPT API. In the live 2026-08-15 page one logical
 * assistant request can also be split into several sections sharing data-turn-id, so
 * turns are grouped before messages, progress or tool blocks are counted. Hashed
 * CSS-module class names are never matched because they are intentionally ephemeral.
