/**
 * What runs on the ChatGPT page.
 *
 * Three jobs. Observation never changes the conversation; presentation may replace the
 * visible live activity stream when the user has Overwrite enabled:
 *
 *  1. Observe. Messages, turn boundaries, live progress lines and visible errors are
 *     reported to the local app. Nothing is inferred that the page does not show, and
 *     a turn that stops for no visible reason is reported as exactly that.
 *
 *  2. Relabel. The app knows what every MCP tool call actually did, because it ran it.
 *     Each recorded call is matched to one "Called tool" block and given the real thing.
 *     Matching is per call and incremental: a block that cannot be matched confidently
 *     keeps ChatGPT's own label, and — this is the part that used to be wrong — it no
 *     longer suppresses the blocks around it that *can* be matched.
 *
 *  3. Offer Compact & resume, as a control beside ChatGPT's own composer buttons that
 *     says what the job is doing rather than vanishing on the next React render.
 *
 * Every selector lives in chatgpt-dom.js. This file only deals in the shapes that
 * module returns, so a ChatGPT redesign cannot reach past it.
