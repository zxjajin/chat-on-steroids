/**
 * One tool, four actions, registered only while multi-agent mode is on. Fresh installs enable
 * it; existing configs keep their stored choice, so a user who has it off never sees this schema.
 *

 * an unresolved request can own a provisional prime family. The same broker later attaches it
 * to the real session's frontend, preserving every worker and any existing fleets. Workers
 * retain their app-proven conversation binding. run_id selects an owned family, not a role.
 *
 * Every result here also carries `structuredContent`. The text half is what the model should
 * act on and is kept to a sentence or two; ids, states and counts are machine state and belong
 * in a shape the caller can read without parsing English.

 * broker keeps the figure in memory and in its snapshot, but a chat that grew while this app
 * was not running — or one whose snapshot predates the measurement entirely — would otherwise
 * be woken into a conversation with no room left in it. Reading it here, on the one call that
 * can wake a worker, is what makes the ceiling survive a crash rather than a restart quietly
 * handing back a worker the prime was already told was finished.

/**
 * Who is making this `agents` call, established for this call alone.
 *
 * The prime holds no credential by design, and the dispatcher deliberately hands ordinary
 * tool calls no authority from "the only chat that has been active lately" — that is not
 * proof that the chat made this call, and stale page state once authenticated prime calls as
 * worker-1. So identity is proven here per call by joining ChatGPT's inbound MCP HTTP
 * `x-request-id` to the same request id reported from one concrete conversation's message
 * model. The page evidence may arrive just before or just after the MCP request; the id, not
 * timing, is the join. If its exact mate never appears, the broker refuses the operation.
 * Missing request-id evidence never falls back to a visible row, active/generating chat,
 * agent key, or recent browser state.
 *
 * The proven identity is then adopted for the rest of the call, so this result is recorded
 * against the right agent and carries the right inbox.
