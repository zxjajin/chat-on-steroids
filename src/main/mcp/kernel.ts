/**
 * The machinery every model-facing tool sits on, independent of which surface it lives on.
 *
 * The tools themselves are split by connector — `tools-core.ts` and `tools-desktop.ts` —
 * because a connector is a discovery boundary and that split is the whole point of the
 * design (see `docs/tool-surface.md` §6.4). None of what is in this file is surface-shaped:
 * error mapping, the call clock, the recording context, the agent key and the result
 * formatters behave identically wherever a tool is registered, and duplicating them per
 * surface is how two connectors would quietly start reporting the same thing differently.
 *
 * A tool first appears when its capability is enabled. For the lifetime of a running MCP
 * endpoint the exposed surface is monotonic: if that permission is later revoked, the tool
 * stays registered so a cached ChatGPT tool snapshot does not break, while the live handler
 * returns TOOL_DISABLED. Read-only mode is applied upstream in effectiveCapabilities, so a
 * fresh endpoint starts with every write tool absent.
 *
 * Annotations matter for real behaviour, not just documentation: ChatGPT treats a tool
 * without readOnlyHint as a write action and asks the user to confirm each call, so every
 * genuinely read-only tool is marked as such.

 * A path named by a tool call, resolved against the chat's workspace when it is relative.
 *
 * Every path argument in every tool goes through here rather than calling `resolvePath`
 * directly, for two reasons. Shorthand then means the same thing in `read` as in `exec` as in
 * `apply_patch` — a model that learns it once has learned it everywhere — and the workspace is
 * learned from every absolute path a call has *proved* it can reach, so no tool has to
 * remember to teach it.
 *
 * The sandbox underneath is untouched. `resolvePath` still performs every root, containment,
 * `..` and symlink check it ever did; the workspace only supplies a prefix for a path that
 * arrived without one, before any of that runs. A chat with no workspace gets the same
 * refusal it would have got for a relative path before, which is why ambiguity here costs a
 * retry rather than reaching the wrong file.
