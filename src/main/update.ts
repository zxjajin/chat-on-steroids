/**
 * Whether a newer Chat On Steroids has been published, and the file that becomes it.
 *
 * This is the whole updater: one pass, run at startup and repeated on a slow timer, that asks
 * GitHub for the latest release, stages the artifact this installation can actually apply, and
 * hands that file to the platform's own installer on the way out. There is no renderer-side
 * download state and no `electron-updater`; the shipping pipeline already publishes exactly the
 * artifacts named below, so the smallest correct updater is the one that fetches them by name.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything here:
 *
 * - **Nothing may wedge startup.** Every failure ends as `stage: 'failed'` plus a log line. The
 *   app is fully usable at the old version, which is why no caller ever awaits this.
 * - **One pass at a time.** Checking and downloading are one operation, deduplicated by one
 *   promise, so a second call while a download is running joins it rather than starting a
 *   second download of the same file. That is what makes the repeat timer free: a pass that
 *   finds the release it already staged stops at the release call.
 * - **The user says when.** A staged update is applied during the ordinary quit sequence, and
 *   `installStagedUpdate` is the button that starts that quit on purpose. Nothing here quits or
 *   interrupts anything on its own.
 * - **A staged artifact outlives the process that fetched it.** It is kept under the version it
 *   belongs to, so the next start recognises the file it already has and reverifies it rather
 *   than spending another hundred megabytes on the same installer.
 *
 * **What updates itself, and what does not.** Windows, and Linux installed as an AppImage. A
 * Linux `.deb` is owned by the system package manager and cannot be replaced without root, and
 * asking for a password during quit is not something this app will do — so a `.deb` install is
 * *told* a new version exists and is given the release page, and nothing is downloaded behind
 * it. That is a real limitation, not parity, and the notice says so rather than implying an
 * update is on its way. macOS is out entirely: those artifacts ship unsigned and unnotarized
 * (see electron-builder.yml), so an app that silently replaced itself there would be handing
 * Gatekeeper a binary the user never chose to trust.
 *
 * What this module does **not** own: the version of the browser extension. The bridge already
 * learns that from the authenticated `x-extension-version` header of a paired extension, and
 * `bridgeStatus()` reports it. A second source for the same fact would be a second thing to be
 * wrong.

 * artifact has nothing to fetch. Those installations are still told a newer version exists —
 * that is what `latest` with a stage of `idle` means, and the notice turns it into a download
 * link — they are simply not updated for.

 * install, so it is both the eligibility test and the target of the swap.
 *
 * An unpackaged run — `electron-vite dev`, or a maintainer's working tree — is not an
 * installation. Its version is whatever the source says, so it reads as out of date the moment a
