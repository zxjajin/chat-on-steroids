 * The local bridge between the Chrome extension and this app.
 *
 * A second loopback server, separate from the MCP endpoint, because the two have
 * opposite requirements: the MCP endpoint refuses any browser origin on purpose,
 * while this one exists to be called by a browser extension.
 *
 * What keeps it safe:
 *   · 127.0.0.1 only, never 0.0.0.0
 *   · the only unauthenticated routes are /hello (a fixed identifying string) and
 *     /pair, which issues the token to a caller on 127.0.0.1 — see the route for what
 *     that deliberately does and does not buy
 *   · every other route needs the bearer token issued by /pair, compared in
 *     constant time, and stored encrypted rather than in config.json
 *   · the Origin must be a chrome-extension:// origin, so a web page cannot drive it
 *   · bodies are capped and requests are rate limited
 *
 * It accepts ChatGPT observations and returns summaries/queued commands. Direct browser
 * RPCs only hand out kernel-admitted commands to the paired extension; a page cannot
 * submit an action, read a local file, run a process or change a permission here.

   * type the old one's message into the chat one last time.
   *
   * A goal may name its own mode, and when it does that naming is authoritative for this
   * chat. The reason is a run that was lost: a goal written from the New Chat sheet starts
   * the chat immediately, but the mode it ran in was still read from the standing switch —
   * off, therefore Goal — so a two-hour unattended run ended at the second turn on one
   * "looks done" from the gate. The intent lives in the control the user pressed, so the
   * mode is pinned as this chat's own switch here, in the same request, before the goal
   * exists to be acted on. Clearing the goal turns that switch back off: the two were
   * written together and a bare mode left switched on would keep prompting a chat whose
   * finish line the user has just deleted.

 * is still calling tools, and "Message delivery timed out" closes the local turn the same way.
 * On 2026-09-03 the loop drafted twenty seconds after such an end, with the chat's last tool
 * call twenty-eight seconds old, and sent — and the chat then had two requests running in it.
 * So the app applies the facts only it has, and the draft waits on both. The recorder's own
 * turn: a turn it reopened stays open until the page reports a real end, and on 2026-09-03 the
 * page never did — its "Message delivery timed out" banner produced no turn end at all, yet the
 * page asked for the draft twenty seconds later and got it. Recent tools keep the draft waiting
 * unless the durable canonical final for that exact turn supersedes them. A bare turn_end
 * cannot do that, and active work always wins. The obligation is
 * filed either way; a call that proves the turn is still running withdraws it (see
 * noteCallAttribution), and a turn that really has ended is drafted a minute later at most.
 *
 * The one ticket that is not gated on the open turn is silence's own (`g-silence-*`): it is
 * filed only after its model's full silence window and a confirmed reload with no fresh work,
 * which is exactly the route a chat whose page has lost its answer is meant to

 * compaction going, and each pickup raises the tab first (a background tab is a throttled one;
 * that is how the 2026-09-03 source page froze solid while its brief was being written).
 *
 * `asking` — the brief has not been asked for yet. Nothing has reached ChatGPT, so the reload
 * is free and the wait is short: every two minutes for ten minutes, the tab raised each time, and
 * the fresh page resumes the ticket the instant it reads it back. Five pickups with no send is a
 * chat that will not take the prompt — a tab that never comes back, a composer that will not
 * accept it — and the ticket is abandoned rather than left to nag: the next working turn opens
 * a fresh one. Which is also what keeps an old chat quiet: a ticket only ever opens on a working
 * chat, and one that could not be sent expires with its ten minutes.
 *
 * `writing` — the marked prompt is with ChatGPT and the brief is being generated. A reload here
 * loses nothing (the stable marker recovers a brief already generated or still generating) but
 * the answer takes as long as it takes, so the checkpoint is every five minutes and there are
 * three of them. The ticket is never failed by a pickup in this phase; it stays collectable.
 *
 * `opening` — the brief landed and the replacement chat is owed. The resume command is leased
 * for a quarter of an hour, so that is the cadence, three times.
 *
 * Page activity never pushes any of these; `since` is when the phase began (the ticket's
 * opening, the prompt's durable dispatch) or when it was last picked up. A phase change resets
 * the count — the writing phase's three do not include the two the asking phase spent.

/**
 * A final-tab close of a chat this app is owed a running turn in is one no-tab recovery episode.
 *
 * Whether the app is owed that turn is its own question, not the page's parting word. The page
 * decides "generating" from the Stop control, and a document being torn down has none: on
 * 2026-09-03 worker-1's page reported its turn completed one second before its `/closed`, while
 * the same request id went on calling tools straight through the close. So the answer is the
 * strongest fact available: the page's own open turn when it has one, an attributed call or
 * current-turn observation inside the silence window — this app's standing definition of a
 * chat that is working, read from its activity ledger before the close ends it — or a worker
 * slot that was working when the tab went (the close itself detached it; a sleeping worker's
 * tab closing is not an event). A Prime or Worker is what `recoverAgentTabs` is a
 * preference about; a Goal/Loop chat is always brought back; any other chat qualifies on the one
 * fact that makes it this app's business — it has proved at least one MCP call. A chat that has
 * never called a tool is the user's own browsing: closing it is not a failure, and reopening it
 * would be this app helping itself to a tab nobody asked it to keep.
 *
 * The silence deadline would eventually reopen any of them, but only two minutes after the last
 * sign of life. A closed tab is first-hand proof that the page is gone *now*, and acting on it
 * is the whole difference between a chat that comes straight back and one the user watches
 * fail to. The episode is stamped with the moment the page went, never with the chat's moving
 * activity deadline: a detached chat goes on calling tools server-side, and a stamp that tracked
 * activity would mint a fresh episode — and a second tab — out of the very work this repair
 * exists to keep alive.
 *
 * Every verdict is logged, because "I closed it and nothing happened" is otherwise
 * indistinguishable from a close the extension never reported.
